This is a TODO list of stuff & fix to do before starting to get on the actual items in the issue tracker.
Down is first.

- fix Mercator!
- do the TODO in the code...
- shorelines: display only the points that are shown (to check: test if the lines between P(i-1) and P(i), and between P(i) and P(i+1) cross the display rectangle: if not, we can skip P(i)
- fix shorelines issue when a polygon crosses the anti-center-longitude line
- allow the map to be centered anywhere even if we're showing it all
